# Swarm-intelligence-algorithms
Implementation of three swarm intelligence algorithms used to optimization:
1. Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_metaphor-based_metaheuristics#Gravitational_search_algorithm_(Rashedi,_Nezamabadi-pour_&_Saryazdi,_2009) )
2. Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_metaphor-based_metaheuristics#Imperialist_competitive_algorithm_(Atashpaz-Gargari_&_Lucas,_2007) )
3. Clonal Selection Algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonal_selection_algorithm )

For each of them will be created a jupyter notebook, in which they will be tested. Also, there can be seen how to use them and what kind of parameters they have.

For GSA and CLONALG they already exist.

A comparison notebook is also planned.
